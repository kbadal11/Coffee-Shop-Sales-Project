# Hi there, my name is Khadra!

I am a mathematics and statistics graduate from The Open University. I am an enthusiastic, dedicated and focused individual who has gained skills and experience of working in a variety of jobs such as a community organiser, where I have worked in the local community arranging events for people in need and carrying out talks with women.

I recently completed a 12-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with Just IT Training. I am looking to consolidate my skills further to become a Data Analyst and i'm working on several projects to develop my online GitHub portfolio.
